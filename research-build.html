        <p>I am generally interested in the question of how does including fossils into phylogenetic trees changes our interpretation of macroevolutionary patterns and processes.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <a name="Including fossils into trees" class="anchor" href="#includefossils"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Phylogenetic inferences
        </h3>
        <p>Traditionally, neontologists use fossils as nodes for calibrating molecular clocks and paleontologists, on the other hand, use fossils as tips but through a maximum parsimony approach. 
          However, one class of methods, called Total Evidence Methods, allows to infer phylogenies by combining both living and fossil morphological data with living taxa molecular data.
          This method has several clear advantages such as the ability to infer the tree from the supermatrix using probabilistic methods (i.e. Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian) or using the fossils as tips rather than nodes.
        <p>Although these methods for combining living and fossil taxa in the same trees seem very promising, they require a lot of data and are therefore likely to suffer from missing data issues, which may affect their ability to infer correct phylogenies.
          Through a simulation approach, I am testing what is the actual effect of missing data on recovering accurate tree topology. See the full story <a href="http://tguillerme.github.io/publications.html#TEM_sim">here</a>.

        </h3>
        <p>Using phylogenies for looking at the tempo and mode of evolution of some traits or at their evolutionary correlation is one of the major class of phylogenetic comparative methods.
          Because of the popularity of such analysis, I'm interested in looking at the effect of fossils in phylogenies on the estimation of the fit of traits evolutionary models and strength or direction of correlation between them.

          <a name="Building trees" class="anchor" href="#buildingtrees"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Spatio-temporal disparity
        </h3>
        <p>One advantage of trees containing fossils as tips rather than nodes is that one can apply phylogenetic comparative methods on both fossil and living species and therefore more accurately infer the evolution of a clade along the phylogeny.
          Also, by the way they are build, these phylogenetic trees allows to have a large quantity of cladistic (morphological) data available for studying the evolution of a trait within the clade through time.
          One way to summarize the cladistic data of a group of taxa is to analyse the variance/co-variance of these traits summarized in a morphospace showing the cladistic space that the various taxa are occupying. 
        </p>
        <p>I am interested in the ways to detect and quantify any relative or absolute changes in cladistic morphospace through time using trees that contain both living and fossil taxa.</p>
