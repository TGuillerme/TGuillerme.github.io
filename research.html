        <p>I am interested in how including fossils into phylogenetic trees changes our interpretation of macroevolutionary patterns and processes.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <a name="Including fossils into trees" class="anchor" href="#includefossils"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Phylogenetic inferences
        </h3>
        <p>Traditionally, neontologists use fossils as nodes for calibrating molecular clocks and paleontologists, on the other hand, use fossils as tips but within a maximum parsimony approach. 
          However, one class of methods, called Total Evidence Methods, allows us to infer phylogenies by combining morphological data from both living and fossil species with molecular data from living taxa.
          This method has several clear advantages: it allows us to infer the tree from the supermatrix using probabilistic methods (i.e. Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian) and it makes used of fossils as tips rather than nodes.
        <p>Although these methods for combining living and fossil taxa in the same trees seem very promising, they require a lot of data and are therefore likely to suffer from missing data issues, which may affect their ability to infer correct phylogenies.
          Through a simulation approach, I am testing what is the actual effect of missing data on recovering accurate tree topology. See the full story <a href="http://tguillerme.github.io/publications.html#TEM_sim">here</a>.

        </h3>
        <p>Using phylogenies to look at the tempo and mode of the evolution of traits or correlations among traits is one of the major branches of phylogenetic comparative methods.
          Because of the popularity of such analyses, I'm interested in the effect that fossils in phylogenies have on estimations of the fit of traits in evolutionary models and the strength or direction of correlation between them.

          <a name="Building trees" class="anchor" href="#buildingtrees"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Spatio-temporal disparity
        </h3>
        <p>One advantage of working with trees that contain fossils as tips rather than nodes is that one can apply phylogenetic comparative methods to both fossil and living species and therefore more accurately infer the evolution of a clade along the phylogeny.
          In addition, to build these trees we need large quantities of cladistic (morphological) data. This information can also be used to study the evolution of a trait through time. I am working with these data using a morphospace (character space) approach.
        </p>
        <p>I am interested in developing new methods to detect and quantify any relative or absolute changes in these cladistic morphospaces through time using trees that contain both living and fossil taxa.</p>
